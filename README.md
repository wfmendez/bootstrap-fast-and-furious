bootstrap-fast-and-furious 🏎️💨

Welcome to the Bootstrap Fast and Furious project! 👋 This repository contains a simple webpage built with the primary goal of demonstrating the speed and efficiency achievable when using the Bootstrap framework.

This project was part of a challenge from the Zero To Mastery academy: to create a functional webpage as quickly as possible (the goal was 5 minutes!). It was an excellent way to solidify my understanding of how Bootstrap drastically accelerates the frontend development process.

Project Goal & Key Concepts ⏱️
The "Fast and Furious" challenge focused on:

Rapid Development: Building a basic, functional page structure in a matter of minutes.
Efficiency with Bootstrap: Showcasing how Bootstrap's predefined classes and grid system facilitate layout and styling without needing to write CSS from scratch.
Bootstrap Fundamentals: Practicing the use of common Bootstrap components (like the grid system, typography, spacing utilities, etc.).
Technologies Used 💻

HTML: For the fundamental structure of the page.
CSS: Minimal use of custom CSS, prioritizing Bootstrap classes.
Bootstrap: The main CSS framework for responsive design, components, and styling utilities.
